Each planet should be colored representative of its real known colors and sized relative to the drawn sun according to the known sizes.

The rectangles should be sized such that the page is completely filled by the array of all 256 with no empty space. For example, if the browser canvas size is 960 wide by 832 tall, you would draw rectangles that are 60px wide by 52px tall (58x50 plus a 1px border). But 58x50 is just the example the javascript should check the browser canvas and size the rectangles accordingly so that once they are all drawn, the canvas is full. It should be 16 rows of 16 rectangles. Each color rectangle should have a 1px solid black border. When a color's rectangle is moused over, a modal should appear near the color. The modal should be completely on the page, have a black background that is 20% transparent, and it should include the color value in the common web programming formats like rgb and hex. The page can include no other languages.</a></td>
